# ✅ Session Management Update

## Problem Solved
Users were experiencing issues where old sessions were being reused when they logged out and logged back in, causing data to be overwritten.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Always Create New Sessions**
- Every visit to `/interview` now creates a **brand new session**
- Old sessions are no longer reused from localStorage
- Each interview session is unique and independent

### 2. **View Past Sessions**
Created a new **Sessions History** page where users can:
- View all their past interview sessions
- See session details (date, status, topic, difficulty)
- Click to view/continue any previous session
- Create new sessions

### 3. **Smart Session Handling**

#### New Interview (Default Behavior)
- Visit `/interview` → Creates new session automatically
- Click "New Interview" button → Creates new session
- Old localStorage data is cleared

#### View Existing Session
- Visit `/interview?sessionId=xxx` → Views that specific session
- Click on session card in `/sessions` → Opens that session
- Session data is preserved and displayed

## New Features

### 📋 Sessions History Page (`/sessions`)
- **URL**: `/sessions`
- **Features**:
  - Grid view of all user's interview sessions
  - Color-coded status badges (completed, in_progress, generated)
  - Session metadata (topic, difficulty, date)
  - Click to view any session
  - "New Interview" button to create fresh session

### 🔗 Navigation Updates
Added to header (when signed in):
- **"My Sessions"** link → View all sessions
- **"New Interview"** button → Create new session
- **Logo** → Click to go home

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: User Starts New Interview
```
1. User clicks "Start Mock Interview" or "New Interview"
2. Navigates to /interview
3. System creates NEW session
4. Old localStorage cleared
5. Fresh start every time ✅
```

### Scenario 2: User Views Past Session
```
1. User goes to /sessions
2. Clicks on a session card
3. Navigates to /interview?sessionId=xxx
4. System loads THAT specific session
5. Can review questions and answers ✅
```

### Scenario 3: User Logs Out and Back In
```
1. User logs out
2. User logs back in
3. Visits /interview
4. System creates NEW session (doesn't reuse old one)
5. Fresh interview session ✅
```

## Database Structure

### Each Session is Unique
```json
{
  "_id": "unique_session_id_1",
  "userId": "user_2abc123...",
  "jobPostingUrl": "https://...",
  "metadata": {
    "topic": "Software Engineer Interview",
    "difficulty": "medium",
    "expected_keywords": [...]
  },
  "questions": {...},
  "qaPairs": [...],
  "status": "generated",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-02T06:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-10-02T06:00:00Z"
}
```

### User Can Have Multiple Sessions
```
User: user_2abc123...
  ├── Session 1 (Oct 1, 2025)
  ├── Session 2 (Oct 2, 2025)
  ├── Session 3 (Oct 2, 2025)
  └── Session 4 (Oct 2, 2025) ← Current
```

## Updated Files

### Modified
- ✅ `src/app/interview/page.tsx` - Always create new session (unless viewing specific one)

## User Flow

### First Time User
1. Sign up → Redirected to `/interview`
2. New session created automatically
3. Generate questions
4. Complete interview
5. Can view in `/sessions` later

### Returning User

2. Options:
   - Click "New Interview" → Fresh session

   - Click on past session → Review that session
